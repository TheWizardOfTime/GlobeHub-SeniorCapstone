//README.txt 

The following ".js" files in this folder are part of the standard implementation of a basic Node.js applicatiopn which uses Passport.js module as the
authentication middleware for authenticating against a locally configured MongoDB database.


The idea behind the organization of the code within this directory is to help others understand how to create their own user authentication for a website.
If you have any questions regarding the formatting or reasoning behind what this code is doing, I would suggest reading the following links.

Any questions that cannot be addressed in these links can most likely be addressed somehwere on StackOverflow or within another tutorial. Documentaion for
passport.js is also a good place to start if you'd really like to get into the nitty gritty details of the Node.js module.
